### 👋 Hi, I'm Ádám.

**Senior Full-Stack Engineer & Computational Linguist**
I build stable, maintainable systems and refactor complex legacy codebases. My background in linguistics gives me a strong focus on structure, clarity, and predictable architecture.

- 🔭 **Focus:** Java (Spring Boot), Angular, distributed systems, system resilience
- 🧠 **Background:** PhD in Linguistics — analytical thinking applied to engineering
- 🌍 **Work Style:** Remote-first, async-first. Prefer clear specs and written communication.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`Java 21` `Spring Boot` `Microservices` `Angular (Modern)` `PostgreSQL`
`Docker` `GitHub Actions` `REST` `OpenAPI`

#### 🧭 Engineering Values
- **Clarity:** Code should be readable, consistent, and easy to maintain.
- **Sustainability:** Refactoring and long-term system health matter more than quick fixes.
- **Evaluation:** I work best with **take-home tasks** or structured technical discussions — rather than live coding puzzles.
