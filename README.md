### Hi there! Welcome to my own GitHub mancave ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ I have my own one-man non-profit game studio where I create text adventure games called Hootie in Bootee Studio (www.hootieinbootee.com)

ðŸŒ± Currently, I have just completed the "five new projects" challenge and am taking a break to recharge. A surprise will await next year's projects.

ðŸ¤” Looking for help with job search :)

ðŸ“« My professional page is www.porkolab.digital, please be invited to check it.

âš¡ Fun fact: I earn my living with Robocop (no, not the movie, but the software called 'Robotzsaru' in Hungarian). :D
