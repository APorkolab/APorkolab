### Hi there! Welcome to my own GitHub mancave ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ I have my own one-man non-profit game studio where I create text adventure games called Hootie in Bootee Studio (www.hootieinbootee.com)

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on a "five new projects" challenge: finishing an adventure game and refactoring a test project. The other projects will be a surprise.

ðŸ¤” Looking for help with job search :)

ðŸ“« My professional page is www.porkolab.digital, please be invited to check it.

âš¡ Fun fact: I earn my living with Robocop (no, not the movie, but the software called 'Robotzsaru' in Hungarian). :D
